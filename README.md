# F1-Diagnostix

Monitoring health of F1 cars on the grid using ML techniques




Project Overview

 F1Diagnostix is an analytical platform focusing on the realtime monitoring and health assessment of Formula 1 cars using machine learning ML techniques.
 This project leverages telemetry and sensor data to detect anomalies predict failures and provide actionable insights to race engineers and teams.
 The goal is to help increase safety performance and reliability by harnessing the power of MLdriven diagnostics.



Features

 Telemetry Data Analysis Ingests and analyzes highfrequency sensor data from F1 cars
 Anomaly Detection Identifies abnormal patterns that could indicate mechanical or system issues
 Failure Prediction Predicts potential component failures using ML models
 Visualization Interactive dashboards and notebooks for exploring car health metrics
 Configurable Pipelines Modular code for easy experimentation with different ML techniques
